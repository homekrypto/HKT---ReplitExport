Thank you for fixing the login redirect loop. The authentication is now working perfectly. However, I have an authorization issue.
When I log in as admin@homekrypto.com, I am correctly taken to the /dashboard page, but I am seeing the standard user dashboard instead of the admin-specific dashboard (with Agent Management, Property Management, etc.).
My goal is to ensure that users with the role 'admin' see a completely different set of components and data on the dashboard page.
Please diagnose and fix this role-based rendering issue. Follow this plan:
1. Analyze the User Data:
First, re-examine the useAuth hook and the /api/me endpoint. Confirm that the user object returned after login includes a role field (e.g., { email: '...', role: 'admin' }). If the role is not being provided to the frontend, this is the first problem to fix.
2. Inspect the Dashboard Page Component:
Go to the file that renders the /dashboard page (likely client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx).
Check how it currently renders its content. It is probably not checking the user's role.
3. Implement Role-Based Conditional Rendering:
Modify the /dashboard page component to implement proper role-based authorization.
The Logic should be:
Fetch the current user from the useAuth hook.
If user.role === 'admin', then render a new component named AdminDashboard.
If the user has any other role (or no role), then render the existing UserDashboard component.
4. Create the AdminDashboard Component:
Create a new component file at client/src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx.
Inside this new component, you should place the links and widgets that are specific to the admin, such as:
A welcome message: "Welcome to the Admin Panel".
A link to Agent Management (/admin/agents).
A link to Property Management (/admin/properties).
Any other admin-specific statistics or tools.
Final Output:
Please apply these changes directly to my codebase. I expect to see:
A modified /dashboard page that acts as a router based on the user's role.
A new AdminDashboard.tsx component containing the admin-specific content.
Confirmation that the user object on the frontend contains the role property.
After your changes, logging in as an admin should show the AdminDashboard content, while logging in as a regular user should show the standard user dashboard.
