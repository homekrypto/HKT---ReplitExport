Feature Scope: Villa Booking System (with USD/HKT Payment + Owner Perks)
‚úÖ FRONTEND FUNCTIONALITY
1. Property Booking UI
Inputs:

Check-in & check-out date pickers

Guest selector (default: 2 guests)

Payment method toggle: USD or HKT

Booking rules:

Enforce a minimum 7-night stay

Apply a $90 cleaning fee

Price calculation logic:

Total = (number_of_nights * nightly_price_usd) + cleaning_fee

If user qualifies for free week (property owner): override nightly cost with $0, but keep cleaning fee.

Currency conversion (HKT):

Fetch real-time HKT/USD exchange rate from:

Preferably on-chain oracle (e.g., Chainlink)

Or fallback to centralized API (e.g., CoinGecko, Uniswap subgraph)

Show both USD and equivalent HKT amount

Error handling:

Validate inputs (e.g., empty dates, less than 7 nights)

Graceful fallback if price feed fails

Wallet integration:

On Pay with HKT: detect wallet (MetaMask)

Show connected wallet address

Initiate transaction via smart contract with total HKT amount

üõ† BACKEND / CMS CONFIGURATION
2. Admin Panel Requirements
Admins must be able to:

Set/update USD rent price (e.g., $285.71/night)

Toggle property visibility or availability

Update metadata: images, title, description, guest count, etc.

Optional: assign wallet addresses as owners (for free-week logic)

Store data in Firestore, Supabase, MongoDB, or another CMS backend

3. Real-time HKT Price Feed Logic
Use a serverless function or frontend call to:

Fetch latest HKT/USD rate (e.g., every 60 seconds)

Cache and update client-side display

Optional: display timestamp of last update for transparency

üéÅ OWNER PERK LOGIC
4. Free Week Feature
Implement logic to detect if connected wallet holds at least 1 tokenized share of the property

On detection:

Allow user to book one free 7-night stay

Disable nightly cost, retain cleaning fee

Tag this booking as "Owner Benefit" in DB

üîç TESTING PLAN
Manual Test Scenarios:
Scenario	Expected Outcome
Book with < 7 nights	Error shown
Normal user, 8 nights, USD	Full cost + cleaning fee in USD
Normal user, 8 nights, HKT	Full cost + cleaning fee in HKT
Owner, 7 nights	$0 nightly, $90 cleaning fee only
Owner, already used free week	Block or charge full price
MetaMask disconnected	Prompt to connect
HKT feed fails	Fallback to cached value or alert error

Edge Case Testing:
Booking across month boundary

Bookings overlapping with other guests (requires availability logic)

Booking far in the future (e.g., 1 year ahead)

üß© Optional Enhancements
Availability calendar: show and block unavailable dates

Booking confirmation email with transaction hash

Success screen with booking summary and wallet address
