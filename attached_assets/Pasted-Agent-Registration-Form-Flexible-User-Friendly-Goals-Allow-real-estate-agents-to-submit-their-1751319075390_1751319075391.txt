Agent Registration Form (Flexible & User-Friendly)
✅ Goals:
Allow real estate agents to submit their application easily.

Do not block form submission due to missing fields (except email).

Capture useful data when available, but encourage speed and ease.

🧾 Form Field Behavior:
Required field:

Email address: Needed to send confirmation

Optional fields (can be left blank):

Full name / Agent name

Company / Agency name

City or region of operation

Phone number

Website URL

Referral code (if they have one)

File upload (e.g. license, certificate)

Profile photo

Agents can submit the form even if many fields are left blank. This lowers the barrier to entry and encourages more registrations.

🔹 2. Backend Behavior After Submission
Once the form is submitted:

The system:

Stores the agent record in your database with a status of "pending"

Marks most optional fields as null or ""

Logs the registration date

Flags the profile for manual admin approval

Triggers an email to the agent

🔹 3. Confirmation Email Sent to Agent
